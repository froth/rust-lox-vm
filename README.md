Rust implementation of a bytecode vm interpreter for Lox.

Complete(except NaN boxing) reimplementation of clox in Rust.
This is the code I ended up with by coding through the book chapter by chapter. If I would start this again (knowing what I learned on this journey) this would look different ;)

Basically me rusting through Part III of http://craftinginterpreters.com/

Repository for my finished reimplementation of jlox can be found [here](https://github.com/froth/rust-lox)
